# Newsapp
an application that is built to complement the KKP (Kuliah Kerja Praktek) based on existing references.

A brief explanation of this “news app” application, where users are given access to search for news according to the title or keyword typed through the search field, select the latest news with the desired theme (such as: headlines, business, entertainment, general, health, science, sports and technology) and to read the news we provide a webview to make it easier and more comfortable for users to read the news.
In this application also news will always be updated every day and can display up to 37 news at once, so that users always get the latest or latest news updates faster,
In the end, if users want to read news that they find interesting, we embed a news storage feature where users can mark the news to be saved and can be viewed on a special page to make it easier for users to find and reread the news in the future.
